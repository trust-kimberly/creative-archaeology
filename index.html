            <p>An installation wherein you are invited to excavate a sculptured archeological dig site. Buried within the site, are an untold number of sculptures waiting to be discovered and claimed.</p>
            <p>You are permitted to claim ownership of any sculpture you discover. Some, but not all, are embedded with chips programmed to point to the sculpture‚Äôs token of authenticity ‚Äî which is created, distributed, and stored on-chain on the Ethereum blockchain. The token certifies not only the authenticity of the sculpture but also validates any claim to its ownership because the token is a part of the sculpture.</p>
            <p>The installation is intended to simulate conditions from which archeological looting emerges. Outcomes will emphasize the significance of establishing provenance and illustrate the compatibility of . The token exists to exercise the artist‚Äôs authority to certify authenticity of artwork using contemporary technological opportunities.</p>
            <p>FWB FEST 2022 is the first staging of Creative Archaeology, scans and documentation of the buried sculptures are accessible below.</p>
