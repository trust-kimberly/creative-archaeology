            <p>An installation wherein you are invited to excavate a sculptured archeological dig site. Buried within the site, are an untold number of sculptures waiting to be discovered and claimed.</p>
            <p>You are permitted to claim ownership of any sculpture you discover. Some, but not all, are embedded with chips programmed to point to the sculpture’s token of authenticity — which is created, distributed, and stored on-chain on the Ethereum blockchain. The token certifies not only the authenticity of the sculpture but also validates any claim to its ownership because the token is a part of the sculpture.</p>
            <p>The installation is intended to simulate conditions from which archeological looting emerges. Outcomes will emphasize the significance of establishing provenance and illustrate the compatibility of . The token exists to exercise the artist’s authority to certify authenticity of artwork using contemporary technological opportunities.</p>
            <p>FWB FEST 2022 is the first staging of Creative Archaeology, scans and documentation of the buried sculptures are accessible below.</p>
