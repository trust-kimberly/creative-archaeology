Simultaneous possession of both components constitutes agreement to the following terms: The Hydrostone sculpture remains the exclusive property of Hamzat until the COAT is transacted to the Creative Archaeologist. Sale in ETH is strongly encouraged. Hamzat.eth and Hamzat Inc reserve the right to void and or reissue the token at any time for any reason. Upon sale, both the sculpture and its COAT must be transferred to the buyer.
