    <p/> COAT a bespoke ERC-721 token programmed to be an inalienable, digital, component of Hamzat's hydrostone sculptures. The contract is accessible <a href="https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x949d27c541ed00335c9bdfb57c4e686a086fcf3f#readContract" target="blank">Here</a>. Each token is the Certificate of Authenticity and Title (COAT) of its corresponding hydrostone sculpture. Any act which seeks to or does so divorce the sculpture from it's COAT, including but not limited to the sale of either component independently of the other, effects mutilation of the artwork. Further, the sculpture remains the exclusive property of Hamzat until the token is transferred.
