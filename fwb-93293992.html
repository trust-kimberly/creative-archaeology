Please read carefully. Once read, if you agree to the terms of the contract, please reply to this email with any comments and your wallet address.

Once read, if you agree to the terms of the contract, please reply to this email with your wallet address /// This smart contract is the Certificate of Authenticated Title (COAT) of “Copy of Copy of Michelangelo’s David’s Ear With AirPod™️” Excavated and claimed at FWB Fest 22. Authenticated Title of this artwork is defined as simultaneous possession of both the physical sculpture and its COAT. Simultaneous possession of both components constitutes agreement to the following terms: The Hydrostone sculpture remains the exclusive property of Hamzat until the COAT is transacted to the Creative Archaeologist. Sale in ETH is strongly encouraged. Hamzat.eth and Hamzat Inc reserve the right to void and or reissue the token at any time for any reason. Upon sale, both the sculpture and its COAT must be transferred to the buyer. Any act which seeks to or does so divorce the sculpture from its COAT (including but not limited to independent sale of either component) effects mutilation of the artwork.
